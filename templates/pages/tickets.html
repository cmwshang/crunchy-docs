<h3>A quick overview of how the ticketing process works:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Log in or create an account with postgresql.org.</li>
  <li>You will be redirected to the Postgres Open registration form page. </li>
  <li>Once you have submitted your information for registration and ticketing, you will see an invoicing page for payment.</li>
  <li>Please continue through the process and pay the invoice immediately or your registration and ticket will not be confirmed.</li>
  <li>Payment for conference tickets is transacted through Braintree Payments.</li>
  <li>Once your payment has been authorized, you will be redirected back to our Postgres Open site and a copy of the transaction receipt
    will be emailed to you in PDF format.</li>
</ul>
